Game Loop:

    capture input
    
    drawgrid()
    drawapple()
    drawsnake()


ECS system:

    E -> snake, food, walls
    C -> position, renderable, collidable, controllable
    S -> MovementS, CollisionS, RenderingS

    - System acts on entities using comp.onents (properties)

EDA:
    event driven on an event bus with pub/sub


entity manager
event bus

movement system
collision system
food system
rendering system

eventbus.subscribe()

while (true)
{
    movs.update()
    renderering system.render(em)
    sleep for tick
}
