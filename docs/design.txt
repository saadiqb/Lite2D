MVP Roadmap for Standout Portfolio Project

Phase 1: Core ECS Implementation (2-3 weeks)
    Priority 1 - Essential ECS Components:
    1. EntityManager - Entity creation, destruction, component attachment
    2. ComponentStorage - Type-safe component storage (Position, Renderable, etc.)
    3. SystemManager - System registration and execution
    4. Basic Components: Position, Renderable, Transform, Velocity
    5. Basic Systems: MovementSystem, RenderSystem

Phase 2: Game Demo Implementation (1-2 weeks)
    Priority 2 - Snake Game Demo:
    1. Implement Snake game using ECS architecture
    2. Snake entity with Position, Renderable, Velocity components
    3. Food entity with Position, Renderable, Collidable components
    4. InputSystem, MovementSystem, CollisionSystem, RenderSystem
    5. Game state management (playing, game over, restart)

Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
    Priority 3 - Engine Polish:
    1. Event Bus system for decoupled communication
    2. Scene management and loading
    3. Resource managers (TextureManager, FontManager)
    4. Configuration system (JSON/INI file loading)
    5. Debug/Profiling tools

    Create SystemManager and basic systems (Movement, Render)
Week 3-4: Snake Game Demo
    Implement Snake game using ECS
    Add collision detection system
    Implement game state management
    Add scoring and game over logic
Week 5-6: Engine Polish
    Implement event bus system
    Add resource managers
    Create configuration system
    Add debugging tools
